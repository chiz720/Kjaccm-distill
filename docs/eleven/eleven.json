Point of care hemoglobin (SpHb) measurement devices have gained popularity due to their non-invasive nature and ability to provide real-time Hb values, potentially reducing the need for frequent blood draws. However, the agreement of SpHb measurements with traditional Coulter Hb measurements remain subjects of concern and investigation.\nObjective\nThe primary objective of this study was to assess and establish the agreement between SpHb measurements and Coulter Hb measurements in critically ill patients.\nMaterials and Methods\nThis was a cross-sectional observational study conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of BigsBy Hospital over a period of 12 months. A total of 200 critically ill adult patients requiring continuous Hb monitoring were be enrolled in the study. SpHb and Coulter Hb measurements were performed simultaneously using standard laboratory methods.\nBland-Altman analysis was used to establish the bias, limits of agreement, and generation of Bland-Altman plots.\nConclusion\nThe bias was 0.1 g/dL, limits of agreement were +2 or -2. This was in keeping with the American College of Pathologists.\nResults\nTable 1: Summary Statistics\n\n\nCharacteristic\n      Overall, N = 1501\n      F, N = 491\n      M, N = 1011\n      p-value2\n    sphb\n11.80 (10.13, 13.18)\n11.30 (10.00, 13.20)\n12.10 (10.40, 13.10)\n0.3coulter\n13.30 (10.90, 15.10)\n12.90 (10.70, 14.50)\n13.50 (10.90, 15.50)\n0.21 Median (IQR)\n    2 Wilcoxon rank sum test\n    \n\nVisualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
