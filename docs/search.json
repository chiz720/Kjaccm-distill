Point of care hemoglobin (SpHb) measurement devices have gained popularity due to their non-invasive nature and ability to provide real-time Hb values, potentially reducing the need for frequent blood draws. However, the accuracy and agreement of SpHb measurements with traditional Coulter Hb measurements remain subjects of concern and investigation.\nObjective\nThe objective of this study is to assess and establish the agreement between SpHb measurements and Coulter Hb measurements in critically ill patients.\nMethodology\nStudy Design\nThis was a prospective observational study conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Bigsby Hospital over a period of 12 months.\nParticipants\nA total of 200 critically ill adult patients were enrolled in the study. Patients requiring continuous Hb monitoring as part of their clinical management were recruited.\nMeasurements\nSpHb measurements were obtained using Pront7 co-oximeter, while Coulter Hb measurements were performed simultaneously using standard laboratory methods.\nStatistical Analysis\nBland-Altman analysis was used to assess the agreement between SpHb and Coulter Hb measurements. This included calculation of bias, limits of agreement, and generation of Bland-Altman plots.\n\n\n\n",
